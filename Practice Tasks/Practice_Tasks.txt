String
1. Reverse the given string (You can take any string)
2. Replace some character of the string with another character without using a loop.
3. Find whether the character in the given string or not.
4. Create tuple, list and set and convert them into the different strings.
5. Convert all the string characters to the upper and the lower case and split it with the        different methods.
6. Perform the following operations to the tuple and the list
	Find max, min, len, sum
7. Copy one list to the another list without using the copy command.
8. Perform below task as instructed
	-> Create a dictionary named student with keys: 'name', 'age', and 'grade'. Assign 	values accordingly.
	Access Dictionary Values:

	-> Print the 'age' of the student from the dictionary created in Exercise 1.
	Modify Dictionary Values:

	-> Update the 'grade' of the student to a new value.

	-> Check if the key 'gender' is present in the student dictionary. Print a message 	based on the result.
9. Perform below task as instructed
	-> Create two sets: set1 with elements (1, 2, 3) and set2 with elements (3, 4, 5).
	Union of Sets:

	-> Find the union of set1 and set2 and print the result.
	Intersection of Sets:

	-> Find the intersection of set1 and set2 and print the result.
	Difference of Sets:

	-> Find the elements that are in set1 but not in set2 and print the result.
	Check Subset:

	-> Check if set1 is a subset of set2. Print a message based on the result.
10. Perform below task as instructed
	Create a dictionary where keys are subjects ('math', 'science') and values are sets 	of students who take those subjects.
	Update Set Values:

	Add a new student to the 'math' subject in the dictionary from Exercise 11.
	Remove Set Values:

	Remove a student from the 'science' subject in the dictionary from Exercise 11.
	Check Common Students:

	Find and print the students who take both 'math' and 'science'.
	Nested Dictionary:

	Create a nested dictionary where each key represents a country, and the value is 	another dictionary containing cities and their populations.

11. Create two lists, one containing elements at even indices and the other containing elements at odd indices from the original list.

12. Use tuple packing and unpacking to swap the values of two variables without using a temporary variable.

13. Check if a given list is a palindrome using slicing.

14. oncatenate two tuples without using the + operator.
